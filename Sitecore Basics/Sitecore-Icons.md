# Sitecore Icons

> Brijesh Patel

One of the basic mantra that a sitecore developer should chant is assign icons to templates. Being a sitecore developer it's always good to ask a question to onself about who is your client? It is not the company who is paying for the website build, but the content authors who are going to use your creation. So making a content author's experience as simple as it can be should be a goal of a sitecore developer. One of the way to enhance their experience is to assign icons to the templates. Activity of assigning icons  should be done evene before you define a field on the template. Matching the icon to the template name should be as close as possible. Prior to Sitecore 8.0 the icons that were assinged to sections were visible in the content editor.

Sitecore Rocks also simplifies icons assignments to template and allows the ability to search of icons.

Sitecore 8.0 and later has new breed of icons more flat and my favourite ones "Office" icons
