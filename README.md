# Sitecore Mantras every Sitecorian should know 



> List of Sitecore Mantras (a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation) every Sitecorian should know from other Sitecorians

## Why?

After spending ~7 years working on Sitecore. I still feel that, I am still learning Sitecore and loving it! (So, as you?!)

I was going through my old books which changed my perspective to look at programming out of lot of things one of that book is **[97 Things Every Programmers Should know](http://www.amazon.in/Things-Every-Programmer-Should-Know/dp/0596809484)**. If you have this book already then you will surely be big fan of this book like me! But if not then I would strongly recommend you to read this book. In the meantime. I can brief you about it.

Basically It is Collective Wisdom from the Experts. Each expert had to share his/her learning via Wiki

[http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/97_Things_Every_Programmer_Should_Know](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/97_Things_Every_Programmer_Should_Know)

97 Selected one has been printed in book and available here as well :

List of other contributions are available here :

While reading that suddenly got an idea that **"Why don't we have similar Wisdom from Sitecore experts"** And that's how this book has born.

Then I was thinking how I can bring all Experts on one platform and that's when I came across two URLs where online book writing idea is already implemented:

1. [http://sitecore-community.github.io/docs/](http://sitecore-community.github.io/docs/)
2. [https://www.gitbook.com/book/gallarotti/sitecore-mvc-the-community-book/details](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gallarotti/sitecore-mvc-the-community-book/details)

I am very optimistic from this book. Because of our MVPs -- This year we got 221 MVPs. If each MVP gives one contributions then also we will have 221 Contributions! And with the new bloggers I see coming I am sure they will also contribute!

In a longer run I have a dream that it would be great to have all Sitecore Wisdoms under one printed book (Feeling of reading hard copy is just awesome!) and whatever money we make out of it we should donate it for Kids who can't go to school because of lack of money.

## What?

Then I thought to spend sometime thinking about book name -- And as you know writing program is simpler than giving name to classes, methods, and files :-) And that's what happened in this case as well. Thought lot of names. But finally liked this name:

If you know meaning of Mantra then it's great. But if not and you are wondering what does it mean then let me help you understand. Mantra : (originally in Hinduism and Buddhism) a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation. e.g. "a mantra is given to a trainee meditator when his teacher initiates him" [Source : Google] And this example struck me . Because that's why we are having this book.
